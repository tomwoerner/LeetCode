-   29/29 cases passed (44 ms)
-   Your runtime beats 62.69 % of python3 submissions
-   Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. In the worst case, the fast pointer traverses the entire list once.
-   Your memory usage beats 98.06 % of python3 submissions (18.8 MB)
-   Space Complexity: O(1), since we only use two pointers (slow and fast) and donâ€™t require any additional data structures.
