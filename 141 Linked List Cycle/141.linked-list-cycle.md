Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` *if there is a cycle in the linked list*. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)
```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)
```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
**Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

**Constraints:**

-   The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 10^4^]`.
-   `-10^5^ <= Node.val <= 10^5^`
-   `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?
A: Yes, this solution uses Floyd’s Tortoise and Hare algorithm, which requires only O(1) constant memory. We achieve this by using two pointers without any additional data structures.
