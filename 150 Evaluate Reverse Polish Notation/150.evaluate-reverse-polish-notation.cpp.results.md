-   21/21 cases passed (7 ms)
-   Your runtime beats 11.06 % of cpp submissions
-   Time Complexity: O(n), as each token is processed once, and stack operations (push and pop) are O(1).
-   Your memory usage beats 58.69 % of cpp submissions (15.8 MB)
-   Space Complexity: O(n) in the worst case, similar to the Python solution, for stack storage of up to n elements.
