`Unknown`

Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,4,4,5,6,7]` might become:

-   `[4,5,6,7,0,1,4]` if it was rotated `4` times.
-   `[0,1,4,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` that may contain **duplicates**, return *the minimum element of this array*.

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,5]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,2,2,0,1]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

-   `n == nums.length`
-   `1 <= n <= 5000`
-   `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
-   `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.

**Follow up:** This problem is similar to [Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/ "https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/"), but `nums` may contain **duplicates**. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?
A: As stated in the results, the average time complexity using binary search is close to O(log n) without duplicates. That is because it operates as normal binary search would, splitting the array in half and eliminating one half with each progression. However, when duplicates are present, the clear separation of halves is no longer always possible, leading to considering additional elements. In an example, [2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2] you can't reliably determine whether the minimum is in the right or left half when looking at the middle two elements. Therefore, the only option left is to shrink the search space by one element from the right and continue the search but this leads to a linear scan in the worst case.
