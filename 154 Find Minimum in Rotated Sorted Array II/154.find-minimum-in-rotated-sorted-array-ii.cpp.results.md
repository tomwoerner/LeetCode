-   193/193 cases passed (0 ms)
-   Your runtime beats 100 % of cpp submissions
-   Time complexity: O(log n) is the average case because the approach uses binary search. However, in the worst case, when duplicates exist, the algorithm might reduce the search space linrearly O(n) in the worst case.
-   Your memory usage beats 27.13 % of cpp submissions (15.2 MB)
-   Space complexity: O(1) the algorithm uses constant extra space since it only uses a few pointers (left, right, mid) with no additional data structures needed.
