-   71/71 cases passed (0 ms)
-   Your runtime beats 100 % of cpp submissions
-   Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because each node is visited exactly once.
-   Your memory usage beats 47.62 % of cpp submissions (10.2 MB)
-   Space Complexity: Recursive - O(N) in the worst case due to the recursive call stack when the tree is skewed. Iterative - O(N) in the worst case if the tree is skewed, as all nodes may be pushed onto the stack. For balanced trees, space complexity is O(logN).
