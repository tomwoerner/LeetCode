Given the `head` of a linked list, return *the list after sorting it in **ascending order***.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/14/sort_list_1.jpg)
```
Input: head = [4,2,1,3]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/14/sort_list_2.jpg)
```
Input: head = [-1,5,3,4,0]
Output: [-1,0,3,4,5]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**

-   The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 5 * 10^4^]`.
-   `-10^5^ <= Node.val <= 10^5^`

**Follow up:** Can you sort the linked list in `O(n logn)` time and `O(1)` memory (i.e. constant space)?

 The optimal approach for O(nlogn) time complexity and O(1) space for linked lists is the Bottom-Up Merge Sort. This solution sorts the linked list without using additional memory, leveraging in-place sorting.
