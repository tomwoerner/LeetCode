-   30/30 cases passed (219 ms)
-   Your runtime beats 21.75 % of python3 submissions
-   Time Complexity: O(nlogn) due to the merge sort process, where each merge operation takes O(n) for splitting and merging, and it is applied over
logn levels.
-   Your memory usage beats 92 % of python3 submissions (31.9 MB)
-   Space Complexity: O(1) as this implementation does not use any additional memory for recursive calls or new nodes; the sort occurs in-place in the linked list.
