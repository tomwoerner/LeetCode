-   30/30 cases passed (12 ms)
-   Your runtime beats 82.51 % of cpp submissions
-   Time Complexity: O(nlogn) due to the merge sort process, where each merge operation takes O(n) for splitting and merging, and it is applied over
logn levels.
-   Your memory usage beats 95.55 % of cpp submissions (55.9 MB)
-   Space Complexity: O(1) as this implementation does not use any additional memory for recursive calls or new nodes; the sort occurs in-place in the linked list.
