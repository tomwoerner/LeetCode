-   190/190 cases passed (0 ms)
-   Your runtime beats 100 % of cpp submissions
-   Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array nums. This is because it only makes one pass through the array.
-   Your memory usage beats 37.93 % of cpp submissions (16.7 MB)
-   Space Complexity: O(1), as we use only a few extra variables (max_product, min_product, and result), regardless of the input size.
