-   47/47 cases passed (11 ms)
-   Your runtime beats 49.74 % of cpp submissions
-   Time Complexity: O(n^2) The outer loop runs n times where n is the length of s. Inner loop runs at most n times for each iteration of the outer loop. The substring lookup runs at constant time (average case) due to hash set.
-   Your memory usage beats 38.87 % of cpp submissions (16.2 MB)
-   Space Complexity: O(n + m) where the DP array requires O(n) and word set requires O(m) where m is the total length of all dictionary words.
