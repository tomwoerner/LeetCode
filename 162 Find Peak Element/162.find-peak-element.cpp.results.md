-   67/67 cases passed (0 ms)
-   Your runtime beats 100 % of cpp submissions
-   Time complexity: O(log n) because the binary search halves the search space at each step.
-   Your memory usage beats 11.55 % of cpp submissions (11.6 MB)
-   Space complexity: O(1) as the algorithm only uses a constant amount of additional space for the left, right, and mid variables.
