Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return *the majority element*.

The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**

-   `n == nums.length`
-   `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4^`
-   `-10^9^ <= nums[i] <= 10^9^`

**Follow-up:** Could you solve the problem in linear time and in `O(1)` space?
-   Yes, that's how it was solved. Using the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm, it maintains a candidate variable for the majority element and a count of its occurences. If the count falls to zero, it assigns a new candidate. Eventually it will reassign the write candidate because we are guaranteed a majority element.
