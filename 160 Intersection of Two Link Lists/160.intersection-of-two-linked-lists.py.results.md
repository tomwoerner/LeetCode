-   39/39 cases passed (71 ms)
-   Your runtime beats 93.85 % of python3 submissions
-   Time complexity: O(n + m) where n is the length of listA and m is the length of listB. The two pointers together traverse both lists once in the worst case.
-   Your memory usage beats 25.37 % of python3 submissions (27.3 MB)
-   Space complexity: O(1) as only two pointers are used and no additional data structures are needed.
