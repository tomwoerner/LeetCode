-   43/43 cases passed (309 ms)
-   Your runtime beats 97.94 % of python3 submissions
-   Time complexity: O(n) - The array is scanned several times (finding min, max, distributing elements into buckets, and calculating the gap), all in linear time.
-   Your memory usage beats 21.55 % of python3 submissions (33.2 MB)
-   Space complexity: O(n) - Extra space is used for the buckets which is proportional to the number of elements in the array.
