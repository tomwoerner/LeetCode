-   27/27 cases passed (0 ms)
-   Your runtime beats 100 % of python3 submissions
-   Time Complexity: O(n^2 ⋅2n), where n is the length of the string s. The complexity is high due to the number of possible sentences, especially when backtracking checks all substring combinations.
-   Your memory usage beats 7.27 % of python3 submissions (16.9 MB)
-   Space Complexity: O(n⋅2^n), where O(n) is the memoization storage, and 2n arises from the exponential number of potential sentences stored in the recursion stack.
