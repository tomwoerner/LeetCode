-   18/18 cases passed (10 ms)
-   Your runtime beats 34.38 % of cpp submissions
-   Time complexity: O(n) because, in the worst case, we need to traverse the entire linked list. First, the slow and fast pointers move through the list to detect if a cycle exists, which takes O(n) time. If a cycle is found, we then need another O(n) time to find the start of the cycle. Each pointer (slow and fast) moves a total distance proportional to the number of nodes in the list. Hence, the overall traversal is linear.
-   Your memory usage beats 74.1 % of cpp submissions (10.4 MB)
-   Space Complexity: O(1) because we only use a constant amount of extra space. This includes the two pointers (slow and fast) and a few variables for iteration. We are not using any additional data structures (like arrays or hash tables) that grow with the input size. All operations are done in place using the existing structure of the linked list.
