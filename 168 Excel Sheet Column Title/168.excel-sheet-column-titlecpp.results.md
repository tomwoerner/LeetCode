--------

-   21/21 cases passed (0 ms)
-   Your runtime beats 100 % of cpp submissions
-   Time Complexity: O(log₆ n) because the algorithm divides the column number by 26 in each iteration, which reduces the size of the input logarithmically
-   Your memory usage beats 97.54 % of cpp submissions (7.2 MB)
-   Space Complexity: O(log₆ n) because the result string grows in size proportionally to the number of base-26 digits. Other varaibles like the remainder and column number only take constant space O(1)
