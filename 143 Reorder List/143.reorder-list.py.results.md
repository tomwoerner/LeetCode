-   12/12 cases passed (0 ms)
-   Your runtime beats 100 % of python3 submissions
-   Time Complexity: O(n) Finding the middle takes O(n). Reversing the second half also takes O(n). Merging the two halves takes O(n) as well.
-   Your memory usage beats 98.89 % of python3 submissions (22.2 MB)
-   Space Complexity: O(1) This solution modifies the list in-place, using only a few extra pointers.
