-   150/150 cases passed (0 ms)
-   Your runtime beats 100 % of python3 submissions
-   Time Complexity: O(log n) because the solution uses binary search, which reduces the search space by half in each step.
-   Your memory usage beats 86.47 % of python3 submissions (16.8 MB)
-   Space Complexity: O(1) because only a constant amount of extra space is used (for the two pointers and a few temporary variables).
