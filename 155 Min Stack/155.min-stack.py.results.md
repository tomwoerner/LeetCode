-   31/31 cases passed (0 ms)
-   Your runtime beats 100 % of python3 submissions
-   Time complexity: O(1) for push, pop, top, getMin because it maintains a stack tracking the min value in addition to the regular stack.
-   Your memory usage beats 91.83 % of python3 submissions (20.4 MB)
-   Space complexity: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the stack. In the worst case, the min_stack would grow to the same size as the regular stack (if all values are decreasing), but overall, this is linear space.
