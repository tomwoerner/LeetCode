-   61/61 cases passed (0 ms)
-   Your runtime beats 100 % of cpp submissions
-   Time complexity: O(n) - it takes O(n) to split the string where n is the input length. Reversing the words takes O(m) where m is the number of words in the list. Constructing the final string takes O(n).
-   Your memory usage beats 34.28 % of cpp submissions (10.7 MB)
-   Space complexity: O(n) storing words in a vector takes O(n) additional space. Constructing the final string in ostringstream also uses O(n).
