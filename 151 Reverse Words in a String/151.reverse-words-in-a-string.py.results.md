-   Your runtime beats 100 % of python3 submissions
-   Time complexity: O(n) - it takes O(n) to split the string where n is the input length. Reversing the words takes O(m) where m is the number of words in the list. Joining the list into a stingle string takes O(n).
-   Your memory usage beats 67.92 % of python3 submissions (16.6 MB)
-   Space complexity: O(n) splitting creates a list of words, so O(n) additional space. Reversing and joining are in-place or temporary allocations.
