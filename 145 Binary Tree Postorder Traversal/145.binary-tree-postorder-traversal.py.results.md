-   71/71 cases passed (0 ms)
-   Your runtime beats 100 % of python3 submissions
-   Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because the traversal visits each node exactly once (left subtree, right subtree, then the root), performing constant work at each node.
-   Your memory usage beats 15.15 % of python3 submissions (16.6 MB)
-   Space Complexity: Best case: O(n) and worse case: O(log n). It depends on the depth of the recursion stack. In the worst case (for a highly unbalanced tree that resembles a linked list), the recursion stack could go as deep as O(n) if all nodes are in a single branch (e.g., all left children or all right children). In the best case (for a perfectly balanced binary tree), the maximum depth of the recursion stack is O(logn), which corresponds to the height of the tree.
