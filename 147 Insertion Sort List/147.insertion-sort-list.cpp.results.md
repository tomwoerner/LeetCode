-   19/19 cases passed (27 ms)
-   Your runtime beats 24.59 % of cpp submissions
-   Time Complexity: Traversing the outer loop (cur) is iterating through each node in the list so O(n). For each node, traverse the sorted portion to find the correct position. In the worst case, this takes O(n) steps if the node has to be inserted at the end of the sorted position. Therefore, the overall is O(n^2)
-   Your memory usage beats 49.54 % of cpp submissions (14.5 MB)
-   Space Complexity: Auxillary space only requires a few extra pointers (cur, dummy, next_node, position) so it's O(1). Also sorting is in-place, therefore overall it is O(1).
