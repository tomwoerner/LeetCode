-   19/19 cases passed (399 ms)
-   Your runtime beats 38.18 % of python3 submissions
-   Time Complexity: Traversing the outer loop (cur) is iterating through each node in the list so O(n). For each node, traverse the sorted portion to find the correct position. In the worst case, this takes O(n) steps if the node has to be inserted at the end of the sorted position. Therefore, the overall is O(n^2)
-   Your memory usage beats 85.07 % of python3 submissions (18.2 MB)
-   Space Complexity: Auxillary space only requires a few extra pointers (cur, dummy, next_node, position) so it's O(1). Also sorting is in-place, therefore overall it is O(1).
